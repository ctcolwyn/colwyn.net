I sometimes feel like a dying breed when I read for pleasure, and am grateful there are still millions who do so. I read to be educated, and for entertainment; a good nonfiction book is a structured bundle of information, often as good or better than a university course on the same subject. The observant alumnus ought to recall that many college courses are simply summaries of a reading list of five or six books, the cost of which rarely exceeds $100! I read in the spirit of continuing education: improving my understanding of the world and people different than me.

As a writer, I also benefit from incidentally absorbing techniques, tropes and vocabulary.

I should mention that I was not always as keen to read as I am now; as time passed in my early adulthood I grew bored of artificial things like video games and popular entertainment via the likes of online videos and streams. For years I was confused and frustrated by this, but I can't will myself to be any different than I am, and _de gustibus non est disputandum._ I can learn a great deal about what I ought to be doing by measuring my emotional affect immediately after things; one can learn, for instance, that YouTube is merely TV with algorithmic recommendations and serves as a similar drain on productivity, and often fun and satisfaction with it.

Regardless, I can't comment on what _ought_ to be; all I can say is that I made a different choice and I read a lot of books. A final note: bear in mind [who I am as a reader](/e/me); my opinions need not be yours!

## 5 Stars

### _Unsong_, Scott Alexander (2017)

Scott Alexander of [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com) fame's first bookish web serial hits home with his trademark cleverness and rationalist puzzling. He expertly weaves some of his [most loved posts](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/21/universal-love-said-the-cactus-person/) into a story that begins in a cubicle and ends in a literal conversation with God.

I struggle to describe its effect on me as it was something of a meta-effect: on its face, I was overjoyed with the fun of placebomancy, and the antics of the Archangel Uriel at the U.N.; deeper, I draw great inspiration from how Scott writes and hang on each word as I hope to better incorporate his style into my own. The story is rough in ways (Scott has shown interest in revising it over the last few years, although no such revision exists as of 16 Dec 2020) but this is forgivable because it is currently structured as a web serial and makes no claim of polish.

I see no need for this revision; it is an extremely playful story with meaning and vision.

### _How to Live on 24 Hours a Day_, Arnold Bennett (1908)

<div class="epigraph">
<p>You wake up in the morning, and lo! your purse is magically filled with twenty-four hours of the unmanufactured tissue of the universe of your life! It is yours. It is the most precious of possessions. A highly singular commodity, showered upon you in a manner as singular as the commodity itself!</p>
<p>Arnold Bennett, <i>How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</i></p>
</div>

A stunning, sardonic pamphlet written in the interest of helping people not undervalue their time. The peculiar thing about writing books from a century ago is how applicable they are to the modern sensibility, and this book is no exception. How antiquated the tone, and yet how playful and irreverent the prose! If this text is ancient I wish to be doubly so.

Bennett was 41 when he wrote these words six years prior to the Great War—he writes like the Village Elder of London asking the next generation to be just a little more deliberate with themselves, particularly their evenings, rather than indulging entirely in pursuits that waste the time away—"[t]ennis," he writes, "is so much more urgent than the immortal soul."

This is the closest Bennett gets to religious connotation in his advice. His central thesis is that one ought to form a habit to better themselves for ninety minutes, three working nights a week, and helpfully adds:

>Remember the chance of accidents. Remember human nature. And give yourself, say, from 9 to 11.30 for your task of ninety minutes.

Thus we know he was an invariant pragmatist.

Bennett's tone is typical _humour_ circa the turn of the last century, and the reading list he proposes to the reader is perhaps fifty years older than that. But his taste, and the suitability of his advice for the modern reader, impresses me. This is the sort of book which makes its point smartly and quickly and which I will recommend profusely for the better part of this century.

### _You're Never Weird on the Internet_, Felicia Day (2015)
Stunning love letter to the young internet from the early oughts to the supremacy of World of Warcraft. Day paints a detailed picture of what it was like growing up an internet kid, complete with homeschooling, awkward eventual meetups with long-held internet friends, and rather more uniquely in her case: getting a job inside World of Warcraft and turning it into an authentic [miniseries-turned-cult-classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guild_(web_series)).

Perhaps I relate to this book rather more strongly, because its central "be-yourself" thesis is specifically geared toward people like me whose entire young life took place on the internet. After reading this book for the first time, I recall feeling that it perfectly encapsulates the oddities of online social life in the early days before social media dominated it, the ideal that genuine self-expression is your friend even if doing so sequesters you into niche communities, and video-game-as-art-form.

I have this book to thank for my mindset that embracing the internet is the correct choice for some, and ought to be one in one's own preferred way. I suspect that Day is probably sympathetic to the view I hold on the internet over time, which is something like: it's rather less pleasant than it was in the early days, forums were better than social media, communities were smaller and more personal and less algorithmic and etc. Day's writing is one of the best glimpses into why I loved those years of my life so much. Five stars, a must-read for anyone—and especially for young people who never experienced the internet as Day describes it.

### _The Great Gatsby_, F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)
Fitzgerald's legendary book needs no introduction, but you can count me among its stronger admirers. Fitzgerald's tale of extravagant wealth, unrequited love and social class does a lot of leg work in a short time. It deserves the acclaim it gets amongst high school English teachers. Of particular note is the final sentence of the book, which unfortunately escaped mention in my personal high school education, and Tom Buchanan's comical misinterpretation of the only book he has read recently when we meet him—himself a character in a book that is often misinterpreted!

### _Waking Up_, Sam Harris (2014)
The best modern entry point into meditation, mindfulness and consciousness. I meditate often, and am often asked why, what the benefits are, etc. and if they aren't immediately receptive to my answer I will gift them this book. (I should mention that this seems mostly fruitless as the recommendation is dead, and we have killed it, but I enjoy the practice nonetheless: _"if I could just influence one person...")_

Anyway: within, Harris robustly defends many off-putting-but-correct beliefs, such as:

- Free will is an illusion, an oft-indulged talking point of the modern agnostic that is mostly irrelevant until you apply it to the fluttering of the conscious train of thought during meditation;
- The self (as commonly thought) does not exist: the fact one experiences reality through a certain vantage point does not indicate the existence of the self because there is no entity external to the body which controls it. Consciousness is merely that _there is something that it is like to be that thing_ (loose paraphrase), but it implies no degree of control. One cannot peer past one's conscious thoughts and observe the entity that thinks them; thoughts and emotions merely appear in consciousness, and disappear again. Meditation is an exercise in becoming more aware of this, to free oneself from the feeling that one must act on thoughts as they arise and vanish; and
- There is no worldly pursuit that brings contentment, and this fact demands some adequate response beyond the usual trope of agreeing with it in passing and continuing to fixate on money, sex, power etc.

This book is required reading.

### _I Will Teach You to Be Rich_, Ramit Sethi (2009)
Perhaps a surprise (as it was to me) for me to like this book so much. I rate it five stars and recommend it so highly because Sethi has such a useful and interesting perspective on wealth and status. He advocates a functionally minimalist position: stop spending on things that don't matter, like impulse buying trinkets or outfits you'll wear once, cut down on possessions that feel burdensome, and save your money responsibly, but indulge in the things that you most enjoy, i.e. emphasize what you enjoy and ruthlessly cut everything else.

For me: I don't need a luxury car, but I enjoy my direct flights to the UK. I feel a lot better about such spends because I am conscious of the cost, I plan for it, and I cut other less valuable things out of my life to create space for it.

One need not be financially irresponsible to benefit from this book, which is why it earns five stars. It also benefits those who are highly responsible and harshly cuts at stereotypical financial advice. The reader is not left wanting, even if experienced professionals can skip over the investment advice.

## 4 Stars

### _Better Never to Have Been_, David Benatar (2006)
A fascinating novelty to broadly agree with a book as irreverent about... well, _existing_ as this. Benatar speaks candidly about his belief that it is immoral to have children. He believes it is highly likely that not existing is preferable to existing on account of the presence of pain in one case and the absence of pain in another case, and that it is a guarantee that life's pain outweighs life's pleasures.

Benatar's axiomatic asymmetry, one of about three cruxes of his argument, is interesting: he argues that if one exists, then they will experience pleasure, which is good, and pain, which is bad; if one doesn't exist, then they will experience no pain, which is good, and no pleasure, which is not bad because there is no one to be deprived of the pleasure. Benatar spends most of the book working to convince the reader that this asymmetry holds. I believe he does a good enough job to challenge anyone serious about their personal ethics to justify their desire to have children more seriously, and to decide whether it is agreeable to create new life.

Benatar's acknowledgement of the futility of the book is a bit crushing in the beginning. He knows he has likely influenced only a tiny number of people to change their behavior, and it likely benefits the text to show self-awareness about it, but it likely also primes the reader to disagree with the book.

The book makes up for this by stating its premise literally immediately on the first page. It hits harder than any other philosophy notwithstanding Nietzsche and would be worth a read for writing style alone. It happens that Benatar is onto something, too.

### _Lying_, Sam Harris (2011)
A brief read that takes less than an hour via audiobook, but a worthy use of such time. Harris summarizes the greatest arguments against lying in nearly any situation, and asks the reader to consider his position earnestly. The book is high-impact-per-minute and is an excellent indictment of common casual dishonesty. I wish it were fleshed out into a complete work.

### _The Signal and the Noise_, Nate Silver (2012)
I'm writing this review in December 2020, just after the entirety of Twitter forgot how statistics works. Silver is no Oracle of Delphi, but he's still probably the best accessible voice to introduce a reader to statistics. His book is stronger when it talks about poker because he can better distill the examples.

He writes prior to the mainstream acknowledgement of the Replication Crisis, which would've been a fascinating comment, but I can't fault him for (again) not being an oracle. The book has achieved must-read status in many college curricula, including my own, and as such it has an academic taste for me; I encourage the prospective reader to enjoy it anyway.

### _Permanent Record_, Edward Snowden (2019)
A good read. Snowden's story is fascinating and needs no introduction in the fable of the modern internet. Depending on who you ask, he is a legend or a traitor, etc., and the book is worth reading regardless.

I have trouble fully believing the book, in part because Snowden has a strong incentive to paint himself positively and likely wants to independently of his incentives (ego), but mostly because of his inclusion of claiming he is epileptic, a long-disputed claim on account of no discernible medical history beyond when he stopped showing up to work and fled to Hong Kong. The main giveaway is that he apparently continued to drive, which no sane person would've done or been allowed to do after an epilepsy diagnosis. I am far from the first person to point this out (articles disputing his claim were written as early as 2016) and it remains the biggest hole in Snowden's story alongside his disputed claim that he worked undercover, overseas in Geneva for any length of time. Reading this book makes me more receptive to the truth of that claim, but not the epilepsy claim; I invite the reader to consider these two points for themselves.

With that grain of salt sown, I otherwise recommend the book. With the benefit of time in exile, Snowden has become an outspoken privacy advocate and has had time to reflect on his decisions in 2013. His decisions are fascinating, and it doesn't really matter all that much which details are false; the overarching story is obviously true and tremendously interesting.

### _Elon Musk_, Ashlee Vance (2015)
A challenging read that likely read better in 2015; Musk is portrayed as eccentric, but by halfway through a long-form biography of him I adjusted to his idiosyncrasies so much that I barely noticed. The way he is quoted is hard to map onto the way he speaks in real life. At the time, SpaceX had not yet shown the now-unambiguously impressive reusability of the Falcon 9 rocket, and Tesla hadn't yet released the Model 3. It was a different world and Musk was much less well-known than he is today.

A common criticism of biographies of wealthy people is such folks' choices of writer. This one is actually quite good. Vance had good insight, good neutral tone, and allowed Musk to be on full, unfiltered display in a manner that I found intelligent and convincing, especially during discussions of his personal problems, exes and children. Four stars, but hard to recommend to new readers. He ought to commission one (or write his own) in the next, say, two decades.

## 3 Stars

### _Modern Romance_, Aziz Ansari & Eric Klinenberg (2015)
The earliest intelligent study of online dating in a post-Tinder world, Ansari brilliantly collaborates with _an actual sociologist_ to write a book about sociology—unheard of!

I enjoyed the book's honest examination of hookup culture as enabled by Tinder and its competitors. The book is actually not particularly kind to (or optimistic about) its primary subject company, instead framing swiping left and right as an inevitability: it offers such ease of use compared to lengthy profiles and manual searching that there's no wonder it has since totally taken over the world.

Although I commend the authors for being among the first to write an accessible study into 2010s online dating, I can't help but think the book was written early. The book was published prior to the rise of Bumble or Hinge (or the heavy refactoring of OkCupid that enabled swipe mechanics there also) which meant the book could discuss the social effects of the general concept, but not the details of its implementation. Thus I suspect this book may therefore bore the contemporary reader by mostly discussing that which is common knowledge today about online dating, its dominance, and its consequences. Such is the curse of being a primary source: this book's positions were so correct that now everyone agrees with them without the need to read the book. Three stars, although it would've earned four in 2015.

### _No Place to Hide_, Glenn Greenwald (2014)
A tale in two parts: in the first, Greenwald tells a fascinating story of his involvement in the 2013 Snowden disclosures and the mechanics of their publication; in the second, Greenwald frustrates me for 150 pages by failing to consider whether the NSA ought to be in the average person's threat model. Snowden argues the American people ought to democratically determine whether mass surveillance is acceptable and he accurately distinguishes between the ethics & significance of (a) the _secrecy_ of the NSA surveillance programs and (b) the surveillance programs themselves. It seems fairly obvious after at least a decade of this surveillance that the average person doesn't fret about it, and (more to the point) would have an incredibly inconvenient life trying to avoid being visible to it. The NSA is so fearsome an adversary at this point that trying to be outside its reach is a fool's errand, and it has no interest in the lives of almost anyone and thus has no business in anyone's threat model unless you are engaging in literal crimes against humanity.

So it's frustrating to read such a long and detailed book that makes no mention of this and serves to inflame past an appropriate degree. The book doesn't introduce a balanced security practice for individuals, opting for an alarmist approach. _Permanent Record_ is far superior in this respect, is a firsthand account from Snowden himself, and is more recent; for the contemporary reader I would recommend this book only as a supplement to that book and would otherwise only recommend this one to those particularly interested in the way that the major American newspapers handled the publication of the Snowden disclosures, which Greenwald does a good job with.

### _The Moral Landscape_, Sam Harris (2010)
Intelligent articulation of the (apparent) most defensible form of moral realism. Within, Harris argues in [Lincoln-Douglas style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%E2%80%93Douglas_debate_format) that the proper value with which to make moral/ethical judgments is "the well-being of conscious creatures" and that all other values reduce to this value, i.e. even those with twisted beliefs such as ideological terrorists, fire-and-brimstone preachers, etc. believe their thoughts and actions improve human well-being on net.

Harris further argues that such concern with well-being can be thought of objectively, because, for one, well-being can mostly be measured materially and almost all humans naturally possess a concern for others. Thus he crosses the [is-ought gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem). I believe Harris fails to provide rigorous justification for this view, although I agree with him on a pragmatic level that substantially all human value-models can probably reduce to the well-being of conscious creatures. The prose of the book is precise but forgettable, and I could take or leave this book.

### _Deep Work_, Cal Newport (2016)
Deep Work is a personal productivity book which espouses various habits and perspectives on work which are geared toward using time more efficiently and with less distractions. Here, Cal Newport uses "deep" and "shallow" work to describe the nature of the work more than one's mindset about it (in contrast to the trite "flow state" anecdotes that often plague books like this). I honestly thought I enjoyed this book more until I reviewed my annotations at the end and determined that nearly all of them were passages where the author quotes someone else.

I think the advice in this book is pointed and useful—Newport offers a valid counterbalance to social media/FOMO/millennial marketing/&c. in no uncertain terms:

>[...] we should not be surprised that deep work struggles to compete against the shiny thrum of tweets, likes, tagged photos, walls, posts, and all the other behaviors that we’re now taught are necessary for no other reason than that they exist.

And he profoundly taunts organizations which ~~encourage~~ force their employees to tweet to the detriment of their productivity like (allegedly) the New York Times. I already abhor social media, so I didn't benefit from this section and skipped the second half. But Newport also provides some useful tips to stop productive people from becoming imbalanced and going insane, some of which hits very well in COVID-related remote-work-quarantine:

>Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one after another. When you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown complete”).

The above is coupled with good advice about ending your workday by 5:30 all the time, no matter what, so you are not tempted to increase your working hours to become more productive rather than learn real productivity techniques. There is truth to this.

In general Newport offers a useful read that is likely quite useful to mid-career knowledge workers who have decent degrees of control over their own lives. He offers a motivating read that encourages you to realize how much productivity techniques matter, and in that sense the vignettes he paints do a lot of leg work.

### _The Power of Now_, Eckhart Tolle (1997)
Here I must distinguish between books impressive in their time versus today. In my judgment, Tolle wrote an impressive proto-foray into mindfulness before western vocabulary about these largely-eastern ideas was well-developed. Are we to take Tolle at face value when he explains he had a Buddha-esque enlightenment revelation at random in a park somewhere? Well, I'd be skeptical, but Tolle has walked the walk for much of his life since.

Whether I can recommend this read now is another question. I arrive at a good impression of the book, but although it discusses many of the same ideas as _Waking Up_ by Harris, it hardly follows through on them as well. Tolle's language is clunky, written more for those predisposed than for newcomers, and his Q/A format falls flat with more complex questions: "why no, Tolle-san, I was _not_ just about to ask you this detailed paragraph-question in response to your ramblings about God, and if I was then it definitely wouldn't begin with the words 'I understand!'"

I think Tolle used language appropriate for the time, when internet effects couldn't yet disseminate his ideas broadly enough for him to be direct about them and be taken seriously; much of his language is more religious than it needs to be; he is clearly writing to a different audience in a different world than the one we have now; his ideas require some translation from this structure into a workable one; three stars.

### _The War on Normal People_, Andrew Yang (2018)

A book I read while attempting to earnestly evaluate Yang as a presidential candidate. He rose to prominence in an online social circle adjacent to my own (Joe Rogan) and remained popular there, but was alternately vilified and ignored by mainstream journalists. Unfortunately, the candidate who most fiercely advocated for rural folks came off as a technocrat (largely thanks to the media) and wasn't taken too seriously.

The book is good. Yang's ideas are worth distilling and hopefully including in future presidential platforms. His [UBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income) proposal is excellent and interesting, and would serve to obsolete almost all other social programs if big enough; the administrative savings alone would be gigantic as useless bloat spent administrating other programs was removed, etc. etc.

I feel no need to comment on all the proposals within, but this was a good book in its time and is probably going to prove prescient over the next, say, three decades once automation at the hands of AI truly kicks into gear.

## 2 Stars

### _Steve Jobs_, Walter Isaacson (2011)
A long, frustrated attempt at properly explaining a short-tempered genius. Isaacson was the wrong choice to write this book, which is a shame because he received the most privileged access to Jobs during his life. Isaacson does not understand or well-explain the technical aspects of Jobs's accomplishments, nor did I walk away from the book feeling like it adequately reflected the uniqueness of what he built. One would be better off watching Jobs's recorded talks and interviews through the decades, or picking passages out of this book with the guidance of one who has already read it and could thus help one avoid the bloat. Two stars.

## 1 Star

None as yet. Perhaps I am too generous a critic.
