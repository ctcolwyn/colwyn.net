I sometimes feel like a dying breed when I read for pleasure, and am grateful there are still millions who do so. I read to be educated, and for entertainment; a good nonfiction book is a structured bundle of information, often as good or better than a university course on the same subject. The observant alumnus ought to recall that many college courses are simply summaries of a reading list of five or six books, the cost of which rarely exceeds $100! I read in the spirit of continuing education: improving my understanding of the world and people different than me.

As a writer, I also benefit from incidentally absorbing techniques, tropes and vocabulary.

I should mention that I was not always as keen to read as I am now; as time passed in my early adulthood I grew bored of artificial things like video games and popular entertainment via the likes of online videos and streams. For years I was confused and frustrated by this, but I can't will myself to be any different than I am, and _de gustibus non est disputandum._ I can learn a great deal about what I ought to be doing by measuring my emotional affect immediately after things; one can learn, for instance, that YouTube is merely TV with algorithmic recommendations and serves as a similar drain on productivity, and often fun and satisfaction with it.

Regardless, I can't comment on what _ought_ to be; all I can say is that I made a different choice and I read a lot of books. A final note: bear in mind [who I am as a reader](/e/me); my opinions need not be yours!

### _Elon Musk_, Ashlee Vance
A challenging read that likely read better in 2015; Musk is portrayed as eccentric, but by halfway through a long-form biography of him I adjusted to his idiosyncrasies so much that I barely noticed. The way he is quoted is hard to map onto the way he speaks in real life. At the time, SpaceX had not yet shown the now-unambiguously impressive reusability of the Falcon 9 rocket, and Tesla hadn't yet released the Model 3. It was a different world and Musk was much less well-known than he is today.

A common criticism of biographies of wealthy people is such folks' choices of writer. This one is actually quite good. Vance had good insight, good neutral tone, and allowed Musk to be on full, unfiltered display in a manner that I found intelligent and convincing, especially during discussions of his personal problems, exes and children. Four stars, but hard to recommend to new readers. He ought to commission one (or write his own) in the next, say, two decades.

### _Modern Romance_, Aziz Ansari & Eric Klinenberg
The earliest intelligent study of online dating in a post-Tinder world, Ansari brilliantly collaborates with _an actual sociologist_ to write a book about sociologyâ€”unheard of!

I enjoyed the book's honest examination of hookup culture as enabled by Tinder and its competitors. The book is actually not particularly kind to (or optimistic about) its primary subject company, instead framing swiping left and right as an inevitability: it offers such ease of use compared to lengthy profiles and manual searching that there's no wonder it has since totally taken over the world.

Although I commend the authors for being among the first to write an accessible study into 2010s online dating, I can't help but think the book was written early. The book was published prior to the rise of Bumble or Hinge (or the heavy refactoring of OkCupid that enabled swipe mechanics there also) which meant the book could discuss the social effects of the general concept, but not the details of its implementation. It is my suspicion that this book may therefore bore the contemporary reader by mostly discussing that which is common knowledge today about online dating, its dominance, and its consequences. Such is the curse of being a primary source: this book's positions were so correct that now everyone agrees with them without the need to read the book. Three stars, although it would've earned four in 2015.

### _Steve Jobs_, Walter Isaacson
A long, frustrated attempt at properly explaining a short-tempered genius. Isaacson was the wrong choice to write this book, which is a shame because he received the most privileged access to Jobs during his life. Isaacson does not understand or well-explain the technical aspects of Jobs's accomplishments, nor did I walk away from the book feeling like it adequately reflected the uniqueness of what he built. One would be better off watching Jobs's recorded talks and interviews through the decades, or picking passages out of this book with the guidance of one who has already read it and could thus help one avoid the bloat. Two stars.

None as yet. Perhaps I am too generous a critic.
