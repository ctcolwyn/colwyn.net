## Inbox

_(These things are totally assorted and are the most ephemeral. I mostly put things here when they have lived a long enough life in my offline queue to qualify as persistent thoughts despite me not knowing where to put them.)_

- "Being foxed" once meant "being drunk"
- The principle that to create good products you must imagine what you yourself want that does not yet exist.
- From my Sam Harris book review: "The recommendation is dead, and we have killed it"

## The Inherently Skeptical Eye

_(Not going to try too hard to flesh this one out on this page, as it will definitely be an essay topic soon.)_

There is a great deal of subjectivity in all knowledge. [...]

## Expanding on Learning-as-Confidence

On learning to code, from my own "Me" page:
<div class="epigraph">
<p> I find strongly typed languages natural. In addition, they enforce better coding practices, are easier to lint, and perhaps counterintuitively are easier to learn (or at the very least easier to <i>feel like you know.</i></p>
<p>Me</p>
</div>

This is an intuition I have that is worth exploring in further detail. There are clearly aspects of the learning process not well understood by most managers.

## On Misunderstanding the Conditions for Productive Creativity

Perhaps the lack of tension in any aspect of life (minimalism, isolation, etc.) is in fact deeply not conducive to writing or productivity? Perhaps I am wrong and the constraints are beneficial? I should investigate this paradigm shift

Related, and written prior to meaningful consideration of this project (which has improved things): Throughout the day, as I have tasks to perform and a generally active attitude situated in those tasks, I tend to undervalue long-term goals. I use "undervalue" here carefully, not simply the less severe "disregard", because during most days the earlier portion of the day is when I would be best suited to perform tasks of long-term benefit.

At the beginning of the day, I eat and code for my day job. I don't care to read or write anything else until later in the day when I'm too tired and wish I had committed some thoughts to paper. This is a most unfortunate dilemma.

As I am engrossed in daily tasks, I am satisfied with my productivity and income but I don't reflect; when I sit and reflect later, I am dissatisfied with my inner life and frustrated that I took no action to better myself today. The paradox is that I tend never to care about those actions until the time of day when they can't be easily acted upon.

It would be worth investing time into resolving this paradox.

## Personal Matters of No Real Import to Anyone

### Purchasing Considerations

- To improve interchangeability between my desktop and laptop at my desk, I could consider a [Twelve South StayGo USB-C Hub](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/staygo-usb-c-hub) ($99; high).

### Tattoo Ideas
- Otter(s) with space helmet(s): I have always enjoyed the otter, and suspect one would go well on my left upper arm. I came across a few source materials and enjoy the idea very much. This idea first recorded 16 Dec 2020.
