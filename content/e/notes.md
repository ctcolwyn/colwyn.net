## Inbox

_(These things are totally assorted and are the most ephemeral. I mostly put things here when they have lived a long enough life in my offline queue to qualify as persistent thoughts despite me not knowing where to put them.)_

- "Being foxed" once meant "being drunk"
- The principle that to create good products you must imagine what you yourself want that does not yet exist.
- From my Sam Harris book review: "The recommendation is dead, and we have killed it"

## How I Am to Work

Various thoughts about _Deep Work_ by Cal Newport. Should go through highlights and distill them.

At the least:
- Need to reconsider how the work day is structured. _In lieu of having a trained, available product manager, I must manage my own backlog with just as much care and attention._ Consider, for instance, the situation on 16 Dec 2020, at which time I had five tickets groomed and ready for work. Two of them related to each other in a manner that would've been invisible without proper attention to the backlog, so it made sense to tackle them in parallel. This is the sort of high-level optimization that is possible with a decent backlog.
- Thus it likely makes sense to schedule specific time for working on the backlog in addition to doing development work. This is chiefly my responsibility, as (a) my immediate colleague is doing one large project for the foreseeable future, and (b) I cannot expect to get meaningful time from my product manager at the moment.

Related to the context surrounding work:
- I ought to implement an end-of-work ritual, most likely written and formalized, in which I go over to-dos and upcoming events, capture everything outstanding in drafts etc., and then conclude the day. This is the only way to guarantee a proper context-switch from work to home.
- I ought to heavily curb notifications and distractions. There are a few levels of potential rigor here, ranging from doing Pomodoros and allowing for occasional checks to putting the phone on DND for the entire work day sans lunch. In any case, there ought to be no notifications allowed on the computer itself except for calendar events, and texts/non-work Slack messages ought not interrupt me so much. Email should likely be altogether ignored or reduced to perhaps once a day. I have begun to use the Clockwise extension (which enough others at the company use in order for it to be respected) to try to assert a proper amount of focus time, as well. This focus time should involve some ramp-up and be respected through proper preparation such as backlogging, scoping, etc.

To achieve this, I must necessarily standardize my task management. At the moment the only system in use is Taskwarrior CLI. Email accounts are all over the place. Confusion looms and must be curbed. To that end:
1. ~~Clean out password manager of bloat~~; _(completed)_
2. ~~Map out remaining accounts with respect to required & prudent document & photo storage, contacts, calendars, and email addresses necessary to manage~~; _(completed)_ and
3. ~~Coalesce these requirements back into as manageable an apparatus as possible.~~ _(completed)_

I completed these tasks within a few hours of setting them and have established a decent flow-of-information paradigm for myself. As of 17 Dec 2020 I must still properly consider the following:

1. Constructing the proper end-of-work ritual;
2. Formalizing a proper notifications policy during work hours and on work devices; and
3. How to approach scheduling (blocking off?) time for backlogging and other things tangential to active development work.

## The Inherently Skeptical Eye

_(Not going to try too hard to flesh this one out on this page, as it will definitely be an essay topic soon.)_

There is a great deal of subjectivity in all knowledge. [...]

## Expanding on Learning-as-Confidence

On learning to code, from my own "Me" page:
<div class="epigraph">
<p> I find strongly typed languages natural. In addition, they enforce better coding practices, are easier to lint, and perhaps counterintuitively are easier to learn (or at the very least easier to <i>feel like you know.</i></p>
<p>Me</p>
</div>

This is an intuition I have that is worth exploring in further detail. There are clearly aspects of the learning process not well understood by most managers.

## On Misunderstanding the Conditions for Productive Creativity

Perhaps the lack of tension in any aspect of life (minimalism, isolation, etc.) is in fact deeply not conducive to writing or productivity? Perhaps I am wrong and the constraints are beneficial? I should investigate this paradigm shift

Related, and written prior to meaningful consideration of this project (which has improved things): Throughout the day, as I have tasks to perform and a generally active attitude situated in those tasks, I tend to undervalue long-term goals. I use "undervalue" here carefully, not simply the less severe "disregard", because during most days the earlier portion of the day is when I would be best suited to perform tasks of long-term benefit.

At the beginning of the day, I eat and code for my day job. I don't care to read or write anything else until later in the day when I'm too tired and wish I had committed some thoughts to paper. This is a most unfortunate dilemma.

As I am engrossed in daily tasks, I am satisfied with my productivity and income but I don't reflect; when I sit and reflect later, I am dissatisfied with my inner life and frustrated that I took no action to better myself today. The paradox is that I tend never to care about those actions until the time of day when they can't be easily acted upon.

It would be worth investing time into resolving this paradox.

## Personal Matters of No Real Import to Anyone

### Purchasing Considerations

- To improve interchangeability between my desktop and laptop at my desk, I could consider a [Twelve South StayGo USB-C Hub](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/staygo-usb-c-hub) ($99; high).

### Tattoo Ideas
- Otter(s) with space helmet(s): I have always enjoyed the otter, and suspect one would go well on my left upper arm. I came across a few source materials and enjoy the idea very much. This idea first recorded 16 Dec 2020.
