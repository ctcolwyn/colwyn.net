I simply couldn't live with myself if I didn't spend at least some time stroking the ego by writing paragraphs about myself. In all truth, it's necessary to properly catalogue my own life and thoughts, per one of the stated goals of this site. I also hope it supplements an understanding of my voice and tone across topics.

## Professional

I am a career & freelance writer and programmer who lives in Texas. In programming, I specialize in back-end software, especially finance and accounting systems; in writing, I specialize in technical writing and biography. I have worked for a variety of companies on a salaried and freelance basis, and continue to work in multiple capacities at a time.

I am often called a workaholic by my family and friends, but the truth is that my career took off more quickly than I expected and I've embraced the substantial income that programming provides in the current market. In general these days, my professional work scratches the writing itch rather well, but as I gain career capital I disconnect from any possible broader audience in favor of engineering managers and executives at companies in niche markets. This encourages an unfortunate separation between the "personal self" and the "professional self" _per se_, wherein work becomes elite, specialized and completely impossible to explain to the layperson. I suspect plenty of others in software are wary of this.

In some sense this project is a counterweight to that effect—an effort to direct the brain toward more earnest self-expressions than writing interfaces to a general ledger. In the past I wrote for private clients, specializing in biography.

I am not currently accepting new clients for software development, but would entertain proposals for new writing work.

### Open Source

I contribute to open source regularly, although typically in the course of my professional work using my _nom de jure_. Nonetheless I can discuss my competencies and interests. I most enjoy the [Go](https://golang.org) ecosystem. I find strongly typed languages natural, and knowing precisely where errors are and are not possible is wonderful. Writing interfaces is cleaner. In addition, they enforce better coding practices, are easier to lint, and perhaps counterintuitively are easier to learn (or at the very least easier to _feel competent in_: an underrated aspect of learning).

I have a somewhat strained relationship with open source, as I have alternated between wishing to make a valuable contribution and fearing the consequences for my own mental state if I have the misfortune to become a maintainer of a repo with 10,000 stars.[^foss-ideas] The [abuse directed at Nikolay Kim in 2020](https://www.theregister.com/2020/01/21/rust_actix_web_framework_maintainer_quits/) shows this is remains a modern problem. I suspect open source was likely more fun in the younger internet. Nowadays I seek out smaller projects & communities that are freer of mob mentality and corporate interests.

[^foss-ideas]: Of course this has proven to be a non-issue for some time now, on simple account of insufficient good ideas. Most of what can be done will be done quickly, and most of the rest requires one to stumble into a novel idea via the ineffable chaos of creativity. If such an idea comes to me that way, it comes to me that way, but so far none have.

## Personal

Participants in online culture wars (or, to be less unkind, "proponents of ingroup/outgroup thinking") sometimes refer to the "red tribe" and "blue tribe" as the two relevant political blocs of society. About these, popular discourse can tell you all you need to know: gigantic in number, politically polarized & generally partisan, ideologically inconsistent and so on. There is occasional mention of a corresponding grey tribe: non-partisan, disillusioned with politics, interested in the dominion of science, reason and research, drinkers of Soylent, inquisitive about AI ethics, fans of [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/). If I am forced into a tribe, it would be that one—although I am reticent to identify with any group.

So strong is my disdain for most common labels and groups that I use absolutely zero social media, except occasionally Twitter, for either this project or my personal social life. I opted out of social media for the final time at age 23 and continue to characterize it as one of the single best decisions of my adult life. Regardless, occasionally I tolerate Twitter to remain informed about niche things from niche people I follow (although, at time of writing, my Twitter is deactivated too).

I enjoy IRC and am active on the [Freenode](https://freenode.net) network. I also frequent various old web forums that are, sadly, in various stages of slowly dying.

### Personality

I find I tend to conform to various introvert stereotypes, such as prioritizing reading, enjoying long stints of solitude, and studiously working at my desk. When I was younger I frequently traveled, saw what I wanted to see, and mostly lost interest afterward. In 2019 I traveled across the US for various EDM concerts and rendered myself weary of all further travel forever (with the possible exception in hindsight of some trips I wish I hadn't cancelled just before COVID-19 lockdowns started).

Among the many potential false contrasts between the East and West is that Western philosophy around personality tends to use language such as "finding" yourself vs. "cultivating" yourself in the East. I won't deign to defend such a simplistic contrast here, but nonetheless it _has_ made its way into the popular culture: I can count on one hand the number of American TV serials depicting deliberate self-improvement (and especially showing positive results from it), but the same shows up in myriad anime. For my part, I recall being quite different as a child and younger adult, and I recall making deliberate efforts to change my behavior at various times—all to effect, unless I'm completely delusional. Thus I stake my claim on the "cultivation" side of the fence.

For some degree of rigor, I present my percentile "Big 5" personality results (as conducted by the SAPA Project on 10 Oct 2019):

1. [Agreeableness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness): 18<sup>th</sup> percentile (low)
2. [Conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness#Personality_models): 73<sup>rd</sup> (high)
3. [Extraversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion): 31<sup>st</sup> (low)
4. [Neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism): 27<sup>th</sup> (low)
5. [Openness to experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience): 66<sup>th</sup> (medium-high)

I was unsurprised by these results, which likely means they reflect me pretty well. Of particular personal interest is the low agreeableness score—I'm convinced it was much higher when I was growing up and has been steadily decreasing for years.

## Contact

- Email: [ct@colwyn.net](mailto:ct@colwyn.net). I rely on email primarily and other means very seldom.
- IRC: `@colwyn` on the [Freenode](https://freenode.net) network.

Other than these and [GitHub](https://github.com/ctcolwyn), no other accounts claiming to be me on any social platform are legitimate.
