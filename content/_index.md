This is the website of <span class="force-normal-text">**C.T. Colwyn**. I am a writer and programmer, and this website is designed to house my digital presence.

The website is aesthetically minimal, and lacking in content as of now. It takes heavy design inspiration from [Gwern's website](https://gwern.net/), partly because his inspiring corpus best speaks for itself in such a setting, and partly because it is akin to what I would likely design myself in a vacuum. Despite the aesthetic similarity, I only borrowed around 5% of Gwern's CSS (but that's neither here nor there).

Below, there is a great deal of blank space which will eventually be a rather more proper table of contents.
