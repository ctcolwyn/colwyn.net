This is the website of <span class="force-normal-text">**C.T. Colwyn**. I am a writer and programmer, and this website is designed to house my digital presence.</span>

The website is aesthetically minimal, and also minimal in content as of now. At the moment I am in the process of translating a sizable collection of book reviews over to this site, which is why you only see one link below. In the future I anticipate many more writings, but for now this isn't all that much to look at. That's okayâ€”all things in their time. If you're here, you're early.
