## Content Paths

- `e` Essays
- `p` PDFs (or papers, etc.)
- `w` Web archives / locally hosted links


## To Do
(Beyond the obvious...)

- Implement easy Wikipedia lookups via `(!Wikipedia)` or similar
- Look into Gwern's "Resorter" for importance tags

## Edge Cases

- For pages that shouldn't have a table of contents, use front matter param "notoc: true"
